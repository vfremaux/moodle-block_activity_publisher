CODING
1. Do not call static function on an instance. Use class name : $ap:: => activity_publisher:: (breaks some PHP versions)
2. Avoid using _ in simple var names (cultural moodle naming)
3. Change non standard :addtocourse cap back to addinstance. Remove can_add_to (old 1.9 API)
4. Static strings moved to lang files
5. Replace error() function as print_error(), move error strings to lang 
6. Removing unnecessary blank lines (no more than one blank line)
7. Use as few doublequote (parsed) string as possible. Use simple quotes for real string constants

FUNCTIONAL
1. Inverted module control from "allow" to "unable"
2. Publishing : out of target implementation. Publish needs adding the resource entry to library and not just making a new file record. This implies calling the "add sharedresource" process as sub process
3. Is_published() query is also erroneous condition : needs check the sharedresource entry exists in library
